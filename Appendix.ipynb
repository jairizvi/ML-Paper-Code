      "Great vid!\n",
      "It's just stupid comparing a gardening video with a video explaining what would happen if you jump out of a plane like you did. Of course the views would be more in the case of the latter but maybe that's not the goal of the former. Also, it is one thing to make a blow up video but it's another to constantly make people stick around. For example, even if I appreciate this video, I probably won't stick around because our mentalities differ vastly with respect to your content.\n",
      "Most mobile apps for editing don't allow you to cut out parts of the video. Does anyone have suggestions for apps that allow that without paying for premium?\n",
      "Watching this video again on another account because it's so good!\n",
      "very good vid. But also ... after every single advice you can watch.... and my clips, videos etc are getting some traction... i kinda cannot still get that momentum  on youtube. Any advice?\n",

      "My brain can't think of anything. Any easy to start idea?\n",
      "You just made me go back to editing a video i thought i finished 😂, thank you life form😁\n",
      "Awesome video. I been doing giveaways content. Guess I need to learn how to make a killer video like u. 1 million views that is so crazy\n",
      "Brilliant video man! I am going to try it in my next one. Cheers\n",

      "actually straight up criminal that you're not at 100k subs, I remember thinking this was another clickbaity video but you truly capture 99.9% of the information needed here\n",
      "This was so helpful…I have 1.1 million followers on TikTok…not even close on YT. Thanks for these awesome pointers. 🙏🏼  I needed this..😊\n",

I added a 4th column to the table - Music and SFX - so I can easier brainstorm, visualize, and imagine the video in its final stages and if I forget to add music or sound effects in the editing in a specific space, I can check back there. I think it would also make the editing process a bit easier. Thanks a lot man! We have to keep going! YouTube is not easy at all, but it's definitely worth it. I hope this comment helps someone.\n",

They have to do with tropes of success, things they’ve been shown over the years that represent what a successful career is. I think that helps you become prey, because somebody can manipulate you with those things. Then you may get to a point in your experience where you become disillusioned with those things. So anybody having a clear idea — even if it’s as crass as “how much money do I want to make, specifically?” — I think that’s much clearer than some of these other things that represent success, whether that’s X amount of spins or streams or plaques. Even sold-out venues. If those things don’t help you reach your defined priorities, then what are those things there for?\"\n",

      "It seems like it's important to acknowledge a trade-off: we have some control over whether a video blows up, by putting more time in to the elements you describe in the video—but there's also randomness we don't have control over. Not all great videos blow up.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems easiest to explore through edge-cases. On one extreme end of the spectrum we might put all of our effort into making the HIGHEST quality video, taking a full year to make one video. But if luck isn't on our side, it might be energy wasted, as it just doesn't happen to catch the mysterious variables of the algorithm. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, we could make a video every day of the year, putting little time into the important elements. This also seems sub-optimal as the quality is unlikely to drive any of our videos to blow-up status.\n",
      "\n",
      "So it seems like there's a sweet spot somewhere in the middle. Where we emphasize quality, but also roll the dice consistently enough to maximize the randomness element. It seems to me like your recent videos are an example of this. In my opinion their quality is as high or higher than this video, but they got less than a 10th of the views. Perhaps trading off a little bit of the quality for more rolls would be helpful?\n",

      "Here is my take on this video, just my 2 cents.\n",
      "1)Thumbnail is indeed interesting and so as the wordings in it. And so I clicked on a thumbnail. However, once I have watched the video and it's not as intriguing or interesting  as the thumbnail (or if a question can be answered in 2-3 minutes but they ramble on for 20 minutes) then I would try to remember the page and avoid clicking on any of their videos again coz they have just wasted my time. Sure they will get a lot of clicks but mostly to the curious audience of YouTube. No wonder many youtubers have millions of subscribers and only 20-30% views and only 30% and from subscribers. 😅\n",
      "2)It is important to create an interesting video that can keep the audience engaged.

      "Should we say this is a YouTube holy grail😂\n",
      "Such a WELL EXECUTED VIDEO. SO HELPFUL🔥\n",
      "Wouldn’t expect a good video after the thumbnail\n",
      "But I did click\n",
      "Your vibe is different from other YT gurus-you are compassionate and easy spoken. Well done 👍\n",
      "This was so helpful thNk youuuu!\n",
      "Thank you very much for this golden information. \n",
      "My next video will surely be inspired by all the content you've mentionned here and also be way inttriguing and interesting. I already started writing my script with your templates🔱\n",
      "These are great points but IS NOBODY gonna mention how this man GREW a 3rd arm to slap himself? 👁‍🗨👄👁‍🗨\n",
      "Do you guys realize that this was the one killer video for this man?\n",
      "Great Video!! I really appreciated the insight!\n",
      "Wow, there is so much value in this video. Awesome, thnx for sharing!\n",
      "This has helped me a lot, even though I haven't yet put it to the test. This is an extremely motivating, inspirational and educational video. Thanks a lot- will definitely reference this every time I make something in the future.\n",
      "I love this video and will try to implement it into my content. But how would you make sure you don't go thru what Mumbo did and infinitely try to make better content to the point of mental break?\n",
      "I got an ad when he said never start a video like this 😂😂\n",
      "whats your music its great\n",
      "Incredible video. As someone trying to make their first YT vid, this video hit so many points I was stressed and confused about, ESPECIALLY script writing, and including points i hadn’t even considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think another way of thinking you could consider with T&T’s is “how can I get my potential audience to feel like they might be missing out on something if they skip over this vid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "My source? My experience with this vid. I considered skipping it for a sec as I was scrolling my homepage, but ultimately decided to click and watch. Now, I’m leaving the video genuinely thankful I gave it a chance and wondering how long it would have taken me to find the answers to some of the questions I didn’t even know I had if I hadn’t decided to watch this on a whim.\n",
      "666k views.\n",
      "need I say more?\n",
      "I just started uploading, I’m going against the garbage culture in the west, subscribe if you’re also fed up.\n",
      "Great entertaining vid with lots of good info! I feel like every time I watch one of these I struggle to put it to gaming content, more specifically competitive gaming content where I can't script, storyboard, or control the outcome of the match. Maybe challenges in game could lead to me making titles and thumbnails before-hand and then fulfilling them? It has me questioning if I should focus on more scripted gaming content with a captivating story and pace even though my heart is in \"Laughing fits with friends while gaming\" content.\n",
      "But what about keywords does it matters?\n",
      "1700 Hundered like?? Nope, 49K!\n",
      "You know why creators leave title and thumbnail for last? Because it’s freaking hard. Haha. Idea for a video easy stuff. Editing is a breeze. Filming and everything else is great. Than thumbnail and title. I’ve made several tests where many of my videos had over 100 plus changes of thumbnails and titles and no views. I can’t design a thumbnail or title but I’m awesome with video idea recording and editing. For example, I cannot figure out what anyone reading this comment would feel intrigued to click. I’ve been at this for over a year now. And still have not a single idea of what makes that emotional change in someone’s mind to earn the click.\n",
      "This is really interesting, thank you.\n",
      "As a small channel hoping to grow, advice like this is super valuable! :)\n",
      "Was thinking about subscribing the whole time watching this video, then I saw you talk about reading scriptures every day and that was the final affirmation I needed. God Bless.\n",
      "Great video! My question tho i have a video idea on making a prediction to a fight thats going to happen. I plan on taking clips of both fighters giving pros and cons  and explaining who i think will win. But how do i record clips/ take screenshots of tweets. I don’t plan on being the focus of the videos. Appreciate the help\n",
      "I've always resented takes like this because it treats viewers like they need to be spoon fed everything. I'd rather make things that are more challenging, things that may not appeal to everyone, things that are niche. The \"grindset\" of constantly making \"killer\" videos that get the most amount of views kills artistry and innovation in favor of appealing to market and algorithmic trends. If you make a video that gets a million views now, that's great, but will people remember it five years from now? Ten years from now? I'd rather make the slow burner, the video that has a few thousand views now, but is so memorable and thought provoking that people keep coming back, keep sharing it, and years after I make it, then it may get that million.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if it doesn't? Well I still made the best art I can make, the art I can be proud of for years to come, the art that signifies where I was in life at the time of its creation and how capable I was as a creator. And even more importantly, I can rest assured that the people who did watch that video, even if it's just a few hundred, came away from it feeling something. I made a video at an old job that got a million views. I made a video on my channel that currently has 759 views. Guess which one I'm prouder of? Guess which one has comments telling me it's the best video they've ever seen on YouTube? Getting a lot of views feels good, but views only really matter if you want to make money. In reality, it's the kind of views you get and the impact you make on those people that truly matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "That isn't to say that there still isn't value in the teachings of this video for me, there is. Obviously for anyone a title is important, a thumbnail is important, a good idea is important, pacing is important. But also remember that the best artists break established conventions and do new things. Maybe that weird detour that doesn't directly relate to the main idea of your video is artistically significant and has value anyway. Maybe that pause or that breath that most would cut out actually adds to the potency of your argument. Maybe that branded intro, the thing so heavily roasted in this video, actually is saying something about the world we live in and relates to the main ideas of your video.\n",

      "Great video.  once you nail lighting it will take it to another level.  The bright wall to your left is distracting. Closing the left barn doors would have controlled the spill.  Nice mood lighting in the background would be a nice touch. Finally the lighting ratio between the key light and rim light feels to extreme.  Bump up the key light intensity  and maybe use a large soft box modifier for that dreamy lighting, really close to your face.  The bigger the light source in comparison to the subject the softer more pleasing light.\n",

      "As soon as your head popped up and you said you came back from editing, after listening to you for around 5 seconds I instantly wanted to leave. Then I realized you wanted to give me the feeling “oh this is cringe” or just make me want to click off. And maybe that’s why I watched the whole video, cause like you said, you need to control how the viewers feel. And you made me feel focused, so clicking off the video never even came across my mind until you tried to give me the feeling of “I don’t want to watch this” by ruining my focus and making the editing quality worse. I’ve heard other videos about how to succeed on YouTube talk about the thumbnail being pretty much all that matters but never anything about the feel of the video has came up. By far the best video on how to succeed on YouTube I’ve ever seen.\n",

      "Best yt advice video everrr\n",
      "Thank you Jon. I wonder any particular ideas about creating a \"killer video\" about medicine? My Youtube channel contains educational videos for medical topics directed towards patients rather than healthcare professionals, with simple tips and reviews of diagnosis which everybody can understand.\n",

      "so stoked when I heard, that you pray and read scripture every day. This video was fiiire and its really cool to see it coming from a fellow brother 🤜🤛\n",
      "Helpful, video! I'd add: as a creator, I actually come in with a TON of concepts & stories that are interesting to me. When it comes to finding the \"killer idea\", what I'm currently working on doing is 1. filtering to the ideas that I find most compelling, 2. writing a few drafts of the script until I'm clear what the heart of the topic / explanation is, 3. THEN asking, \"what question or framing really makes this concept leap to life?\" I think the process of finding a \"killer idea\" is less about gimmicks or random brainstorms, & more about understanding something so deeply you uncover what will make it fascinating to others, too.\n",
      "Great breakdown. Can confirm scripting before any filming is a HUGE time saver - obviously.\n",

      "what a dope video with such great points. especially the theater ticket analogy, that was very well put.\n",
      "You should upload more!\n",
      "RIP dan's travels hahhaha. Great video and following all of these tips will further separate you from the crowd not only because of the principle of each tip, but also because many people won't be willing to do all of this work and you will immediately be apart of a select few that will\n",

      "Love this so much!\n",
      "So for a hook would you recommend a brief story to draw emotion with broll over it? Or just talking head straight to the point heres what we’re learning today. My next video is a tutorial on how to get separate audio tracks while live streaming\n",

      "I want to see more of your videos!\n",
      "Your title examples were REALLY helpful, thank you so much. Could you make a quick video on making good titles?\n",
      "Great Video, Liked the script idea and also doing the pre drawings before the thumbnail. Even though i am not good at drawing would help a lot with putting ideas together.\n",
      "Hi! I’m really glad that you’ve made a video on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve also researched on how to make a GREAT video and basically did my own case study on this.\n",

      "Thank you!!!\n",
      "This was a great video!! *I have experienced this myself!! On this channel I uploaded around 15 videos, but I didn’t focus on titles/thumbnails/keywords etc etc… Then on another channel I randomly uploaded a video, this time I spent MOST of the time in designing an ATTRACTIVE thumbnail, using a shirt but descriptive title, and focusing on aspects like description/keywords etc - and that one video got 50k views / I know this is not a lot by any means… but MUCH better than all those videos that just got 100-150 views each!*\n",
      "I already realised that making 1 great video in like a few weeks/ a month is far better than uploading daily/ 2 or 3 times weekly\n",
      "Great Video !!\n",
      "Make more of these my guy\n",
      "He said killer so many times he probably got demonetized lol\n",

      "Wow looks like I'm about to blow up after this thanks for the advice :)\n",
      "I once had a recorded video sitting in my hard drive for MONTHS (because I was lazy lol). The video itself wasn’t good but since one of my other videos blew up I decided to upload it to take advantage of the new viewers.\n",
      "I spent plenty of time crafting a good title and thumbnail and that video got 100k views in about a week. \n",

      "Making a clickable video > making a perfect video\n",
      "1:45 I’m sure that ankle mobility video could get more views with a more clickbaity title (like “this 1 thing is KILLING your leg gains”). The title is technically not clickbait since bad ankle mobility means you won’t be able to use your full range of motion during leg exercises\n",

      "Thanks for this! Will definitely look at applying these to my next videos. Fingers crossed we get that \"blow up\" one day! 🤞\n",

      "Hey Jon! That’s a awesome topic and also great video but why on the actual thumbnail you don’t use a table or screenshot of youtube statistics with a lot of views or famous youtubers? Maybe this could make your killer video tutorial a killer video 😛\n",

      "Fireee content bro 🔥\n",
      "Great video Jon! I’m interested to know. Does YouTube “punish” people for inconsistent upload schedule? Personally I believe in uploading quality videos not in quantity, but a big YouTuber recently told me that that strategy can’t really help a small YouTuber grow. \n",
      "Would be interesting to know your take on this…\n",
      "Imagine this one blows up next week\n",
      "I've now started to plan my title/thumbnail BEFORE writing the rest of the video and it makes such a big difference. The right title/thumbnail combo can make your hook much more effective! Great video!\n",

      "So my channel will be centered on two main topics/ideas. Homesteading and jiu jitsu. Both are saturated on youtube so I wanted to focus in on the idea of jiu jitsu for busy dad's/whole family. And homesteading from scratch with no real experience as me and my family are just moving to a farm within the next month and will begin building the infrastructure for farming and raising livestock. In your opinion would these be \"niched\" down enough or too much to gain traction with an audience? I'm not nececerilly looking to have a million subscribers really but would be happy with even 1,000 lileminded individuals who really share my ideals and passions.\n",
