During the summer, I wrote a research paper about assessing the YouTube video quality based on metrics like the number of likes, dislikes, comments, and views, utilizing machine learning, data analytics, and data scraping to achieve this. The research paper got published to the peer-reviewed NHJSJ Journal (The National High School Journal of Science Journal). After I published the research paper, I worked with a non-profit organization that found interest and usefulness with the machine learning model I made, the idea being that they could utilize my model to find the statistically best educational videos for underprivileged kids. This organization is called RACHEL (Remote Area Community Hotspot for Education and Learning). Here is a link to the published paper on the NHSJS site: [https://nhsjs.com/2024/enhancing-viewer-experience-on-youtube-a-machine-learning-approach-for-assessing-tutorial-video-quality/#google_vignette](url)
